encoder
  takes in sentence and transforms it into a feature tensor/vector
  takes into account words around it
  good for
    masked language models
    sequence classification
  models
    bert
    roberta
    albert
decoder
  converts input into a feature tensor/vector
  takes into account only the word and the previous words
  models
    gpt2
  good for
    causal language modeling
sequence to sequence
  encoder provides meaning
  decoder produces text
  good for
    translation
    summarization
  can be a mix of encoder and decoder models
  models

  RNN model using scrappy techniques (published 2021)

  developed a conversations mining bot to extract conversations in a discord server
  could not use the bot for DMs so had to use a risky open source software for it
    https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter
  read up on what task chatting may beling in
    https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/how-to-use-huggingface-in-your-chatbot-216ecc9a2170
  came across an article for deploying on aws
    https://towardsdatascience.com/deploy-chatbots-in-web-sites-using-hugging-face-dlcs-be59a86fd7ba
  found the task: conversational
  found an article handling the same challenge
    https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/discord-ai-chatbot/
  cleaned the content from any unfamiliar text
    took a bit longer than expected
    the original reddit dataset did not contain any urls, emojis, or special patterns/symbols
  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15wa925dj7jvdvrz8_z3vU7btqAFQLVlG#scrollTo=CjZaN5ilgd-z
    provided a guide for pretraining the model
  Seq2Seq pipeline was not suitable for the Dialo model
  Could not build the bot with only huggingface had to turn to the following guide
    https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15wa925dj7jvdvrz8_z3vU7btqAFQLVlG#scrollTo=CjZaN5ilgd-z
  After hours of training on colab I had only a few minutes remaining before my runtime disconnected and lost all my progress
    lesson: make sure your model is saved throught the process
  The way the data was split into train test was dynamic and not static
  created a manual pipeline that flows without issues
    still need to improve and standardize the inputs before automating it
  the .ipynb files display all the output data on git, therefore I have to restart git
  learned to develop cli with config to then implement
  need to restructure code to work as a singular bot
    begin by directing user to create config file
      discord bot API key
      discord guild name
      discord user to mimic
      huggingface API key
      model name
      amt of context
  create tests and raise errors for mine_data
    adding more init tests
    create mine tests and raise errors
  need to deal with huggingface api key
    use official cli
  set up the default init path to guide to config path
    if default init is config then simply add it to [general]
  need to add a way to extrapolate data by randomizing context
    added data extrapolation option
  clean data
  train
